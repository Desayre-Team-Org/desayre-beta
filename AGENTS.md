# Project Documentation for AI Agents

## Project Overview

**Status**: New/Empty Repository  
**Description**: This is a newly initialized Git repository at the very beginning of its development lifecycle. No source code, configuration files, or project structure has been established yet.

**Location**: `d:\TRABALHO MARKETING DIGITAL\PROJETOS NETTIN\ANARKOM\xxxx\desayre-git\desayre-beta`

---

## Current State

As of the initial analysis (2026-02-04), this repository contains:
- ✅ Git version control initialized (`.git/` directory present)
- ❌ No source code files
- ❌ No configuration files (pyproject.toml, package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.)
- ❌ No build scripts or CI/CD configuration
- ❌ No documentation (README, LICENSE, etc.)
- ❌ No test files

---

## Technology Stack

**To be determined.** The technology stack has not been decided yet. Common options to consider:

| Language/Framework | Config File | Use Case |
|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| Python | `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `requirements.txt` | Data science, backend, scripting |
| Node.js | `package.json` | Web frontend, backend services |
| Rust | `Cargo.toml` | Systems programming, performance-critical apps |
| Go | `go.mod` | Backend services, CLI tools |
| Java/Kotlin | `pom.xml`, `build.gradle` | Enterprise applications |
| C# | `.csproj`, `.sln` | Windows applications, games |

---

## Project Structure

**To be defined.** The codebase organization should be documented here once established.

### Recommended Structure by Language

**Python Project:**
```
project-name/
├── src/
│   └── package_name/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── module.py
├── tests/
│   └── test_module.py
├── docs/
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
```

**Node.js Project:**
```
project-name/
├── src/
│   └── index.js
├── tests/
│   └── index.test.js
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
```

---

## Build and Development Commands

**To be documented.** Once the project is set up, add common commands here:

```bash
# Install dependencies
# [command]

# Build the project
# [command]

# Run tests
# [command]

# Start development server
# [command]

# Lint and format
# [command]
```

---

## Code Style Guidelines

**To be defined.** Consider adopting:
- Linting tools (ESLint, Ruff, Clippy, etc.)
- Formatting tools (Prettier, Black, rustfmt, etc.)
- Style guides for the chosen language

---

## Testing Strategy

**To be implemented.** Consider:
- Unit testing framework
- Integration testing approach
- Test coverage goals
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

---

## Deployment

**To be planned.** Document deployment procedures once established:
- Deployment targets (cloud provider, on-premise, etc.)
- Containerization (Docker, etc.)
- Environment configuration
- Release process

---

## Security Considerations

**To be addressed.** Once development begins:
- Dependency scanning
- Secret management
- Code security scanning
- Authentication/Authorization strategy

---

## Next Steps for Project Initialization

1. **Choose a technology stack** based on project requirements
2. **Create initial project structure** with appropriate configuration files
3. **Set up version control workflow** (branching strategy, commit conventions)
4. **Initialize dependency management** (package manager, virtual environment)
5. **Add essential files**: README.md, LICENSE, .gitignore
6. **Set up development environment** (IDE configuration, dev tools)
7. **Implement basic CI/CD** (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
8. **Establish testing framework** from the start
9. **Document architecture decisions** in this file

## Notes for AI Agents

When this file indicates content is "To be determined" or "To be defined", it means:
- The project is in early stages and those decisions haven't been made yet
- You should check with the user before making assumptions about technology choices
- Any significant architectural decisions should be documented here after implementation

Always verify the current state of the repository before proceeding with development tasks.
